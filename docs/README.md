# API Documentation – Nutritional Deficiency Detection Using Deep Learning

Welcome to the API documentation for the **Nutritional Deficiency Detection** project. This guide provides detailed reference material for the internal Python modules and classes used in the system, particularly focusing on data handling and preparation.

---

## Overview

This project aims to detect nutritional deficiencies using a deep learning pipeline that leverages both image and tabular data.

This documentation is divided into:

- `custom_data_generator.py` – Multi-modal Keras data generator  
- `data_manager.py` – Dataset preparation, mapping, and management  
- Examples – Sample usage of core components in training/evaluation

---

## Modules Covered

### 1. `MultiModalDataGenerator`
> File: [`custom_data_generator.py`](./custom-data-generator.md)

A Keras `Sequence` generator that merges image and tabular data for training multi-input models.

- Batch generation
- Augmentation support
- On-the-fly shuffling
- Feature scaling

---

### 2. `NHANESImageMapper`
> File: [`data_manager.py`](./data-manager.md)

Responsible for:
- Reading tabular and image metadata
- Pairing image and tabular data
- Stratified train-test splitting
- Normalization and data formatting
